System Overview and Design Philosophy

High-Level description

AgriQuest is a 3D mobile farming simulation game developed using the Unity game engine. It is designed to support students in Kenya‚Äôs CBC by transforming agriculture learning into an interactive, gamified experience. The application empowers learners to virtually engage in soil preparation, planting, crop maintenance, harvesting and animal feeding while guided by an AI chatbot assistant named AgriBot.

The game simulates a smart farm where players take on the role of young digital farmers. They perform hands-on tasks aligned with the agriculture curriculum for Grades 4‚Äì9. These include weeding the land, planting CBC-relevant crops, watering, applying compost, harvesting and chicken farming.

Players interact with the game by tapping on different objects and tools such as a hoe, watering can, seeds and compost. As actions are performed correctly, the system provides feedback via AgriBot and awards points to reinforce learning. The AI chatbot helps explain farming concepts, clarify student questions and offer encouragement using a rules-based dialogue engine.

The game is optimized for Android and IOS mobile devices and is built with performance in mind, using lightweight 3D assets and modular scripts. It supports both offline play and potential WebGL deployment for browser-based access. All user interactions are local and do not require internet access, making the app suitable for low-resource environments.

Design Principles

These are the principles that will help manage the complexity of the design process, reduce errors and ensure high-quality software.

Modularity: Each game mechanic is its own script.

Scalability: Support for future crops and levels.

Performance: Lightweight models and textures for mobile.

Simplicity: Kid-friendly UI and UX.

Education-First: CBC alignment over realism.

Architectural Design

Architecture Style

AgriQuest AI is designed using a modular, component-based architecture following the principles of Unity‚Äôs MonoBehaviour scripting model. This architecture is well-suited for real-time, event-driven applications like 3D games and allows for high flexibility, reuse of components and clear separation of concerns.

The system primarily follows a layered and event-driven architecture composed of the following core layers:

## 1.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØPresentation Layer (UI Layer):

This includes the user interface components such as buttons (‚ÄúPlant‚Äù, ‚ÄúUse Hoe‚Äù, ‚ÄúWater‚Äù), score displays and the AgriBot dialogue box. All user interactions, like tapping on a soil tile or choosing a tool, are captured here and passed to the logic layer.

## 2.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØGame Logic Layer (Gameplay Scripts):

This layer contains C# scripts attached to Unity GameObjects. It handles player actions such as soil preparation, crop growth timers and harvesting. GameObjects respond to events like user taps using Unity‚Äôs input system (e.g., OnMouseDown, OnPointerClick for mobile touch).

## 3.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØAI Assistant Layer (AgriBot):

A rules-based logic layer that delivers predefined chatbot responses. This component operates in response to user-selected questions and offers feedback based on in-game actions. The current version is static, but the architecture allows for future integration of dynamic AI using cloud services. It is integrated with Botpress, a third-party AI chatbot platform. Unity acts as the frontend for triggering and displaying responses.

4.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØData/Service Layer (optional in MVP):

While the MVP does not require persistent data storage, the architecture leaves room for optional components like local save systems, in-memory session data and cloud integration for analytics or student tracking.

5.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØDeployment Layer:

The game is designed for two deployment modes:

- Mobile (Android): built using Unity‚Äôs Android build system

- WebGL: exportable as a browser game for demo and showcase purposes

Communication between layers is event-based and primarily one-directional from the UI to the logic scripts. Unity‚Äôs Inspector interface allows for quick modular linking between components without hardcoding dependencies. This allows individual team members to work on separate modules (e.g., UI, soil logic, chatbot) without interfering with each other‚Äôs workflows.

The component-based approach ensures that core gameplay elements such as crops, soil and tools can be created as prefabs with scripts that can be reused or extended in future versions.

This architecture style enables:

Easy expansion such as add more crops or levels.

Reusability of scripts and UI elements

Clear testing and debugging pathways

Lightweight performance suitable for mobile devices

Component Description

Frontend vs backend Separation

The frontend platform is the Unity game which will handle game visuals, buttons, interactions, player inputs, the chat UI (AgriBot panel), sending and receiving chat messages from Botpress and the local scoring and logic.

The backend platform is Botpress which will handle Ai conversation logic, decision trees or intents, message flow and dynamic replies and later on add curriculum-specific AI skills. The API used will be the Botpress Converse API.

The table contains the different components of the game and what they do:

Normalization Level:

The user entity is normalized to 3NF:

Each field is atomic.

No redundant groups or repeating columns.

All non-key attributes are functionally dependent on the primary key.

There are no transitive dependencies.

Exceptions (Firebase-optimized design):

farm State and chatHistory include arrays and nested structures, which:

Intentionally violate 1NF (non-atomic values)

Are optimized for flat, fast-access JSON in Firebase

Allow efficient single-document reads/writes

State Diagram for a plant in AgriQuest

Let‚Äôs use a maize crop as an example.

The Crop Can Be in These States:

## 1.‚ÄØEmpty Soil.

## 2.‚ÄØPlanted.

## 3.‚ÄØGrowing

4.‚ÄØReady to Harvest.

5.‚ÄØHarvested.

Each state changes when a player does something (like clicking a button), or when enough time has passed.

Text-Based State Diagram: Crop

Here‚Äôs how it works:

üü´ Empty Soil

‚Üì (Player plants seed)

üå± Planted

‚Üì (Player waters OR time passes)

üåø Growing

‚Üì (After a few seconds)

üåΩ Ready to Harvest

‚Üì (Player taps harvest)

üß∫ Harvested

‚Üì (Resets)

üü´ Back to Empty Soil

Events That Cause Changes (Transitions)

Player taps ‚ÄúPlant‚Äù > moves from Empty Soil > Planted.

Timer runs or player waters > moves from Planted > Growing.

Timer ends > Growing > Ready to Harvest.

Player taps ‚ÄúHarvest‚Äù > becomes Harvested.

System resets tile > returns to Empty.

Non-Functional Design Considerations

These are things we considered that don‚Äôt directly affect how the game looks, but help make sure it works well, is easy to use, and can grow in the future and inclusive of more interactivity.

Performance Optimization (Make it run smoothly)

We want AgriQuest to run well, even on low-end phones and school computers.

What we‚Äôre doing:

Using small, light 3D models (so the game loads faster).

Keeping the textures simple.

Turning off heavy Unity features we don‚Äôt need.

Using mobile-friendly settings in Unity, but still learning its functionality.

Importance: So, the game doesn‚Äôt lag or crash, especially on older devices.

Security Design (Keep users safe)

Since we‚Äôre building a school learning game, we don‚Äôt want to risk students‚Äô personal data.

What we‚Äôre doing:

The student‚Äôs data is safeguarded through PlayProtect offered by Google, this is due to the fact that students are downloading the game through Google Play, hence safeguarding their data.

Importance: To keep things safe for schools and students.

Scalability Plans (Make it easy to expand later)

We want AgriQuest to grow in the future, more crops, more levels, more topics and more relevance to the current Curriculum by supplementing classroom teaching and learning.

What we intend to do:

Breaking the game into individual pieces (soil, planting, chatbot), so we can add more without starting all over.

Keeping AgriBot simple now, still AI but ready to connect to real AI later (like ChatGPT or Azure).

Making the design flexible for Grades 4‚Äì9 or even beyond.

Importance: So, we can easily improve the game after the MVP is done.

Availability & Fault Tolerance (Make it reliable and accessible)

We want learners to always be able to use the game regardless of the internet.

What we‚Äôre doing:

The whole game works offline (no need for Wi-Fi or data) and offline.

We plan to support three versions:

Android.

Web (WebGL for projectors/laptops).

iOS.

If the player makes a mistake, they get helpful feedback, not a crash.

Importance: So, it‚Äôs always available, even in schools with poor network access.

Usability & Accessibility Design (Make it easy and fair for all users)

We want all students to understand how to play, even younger ones or those with visual or reading challenges.

What we‚Äôre working on:

Using big buttons and large fonts.

Clear colors to show progress (e.g. green = growing, brown = cleared soil).

Simple, CBC-level messages.

Touch-based only (no keyboard).

Planning to add sound cues/ effects.

Importance: To make the game friendly and inclusive for every learner.
